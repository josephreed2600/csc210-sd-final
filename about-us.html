        <p>Here at Rosie LLC, we are a small team of 4 talented individuals that put our minds together to think of
            inventions to help mankind. Our focus is to think of products that can help people in their day to day
            lives, such as our flagship product, the Clothes Folding Robot. There will be many more products later on in
            the future and we have many ideas in the works all being tested to see which ones will benefit mankind the
            most.</p>

        <p>Many of our products, now and in the future, will aim to complete tasks that are seen as difficult, time
            consuming or tedious. Our first invention was designed and built with that idea in mind, making folding
            laundry as simple as putting your clean laundry next to it and it folds it for you. It can detect exactly
            what type of garment it is and will fold it accordingly. Many of the products we have visions for will
            follow the same idea of filling a need and will hopefully be in production in the near future. More
            information will be posted as it is available so stay tuned.</p>
