            Rosie is a fully customizable clothes folding machine that will fold your clothes to your liking. From standard clothes folding,
            American flag fold, to even custom settings, You can personalize Rosie to your complete liking. The way it works is you place in
            your article of clothing face up (or face down if you want your clothes to be folded backwards like a weirdo) and it gets placed
            in a conveyor belt. Once it's one the conveyor belt, you must then select the customization of how you want the conveyor belt to 
            fold the article of clothing and it then will extend various robotic arms that will fold it to the setting chosen. "But won't it rip
            my clothes?", you may ask, but if the robotic arms sense any tension past a certain thresh hold, it will then cease pulling to avoid
            tearing the clothes. "This must take forever to do though," is probably what you say next. Well, I must inform you that it takes only (approximately, size may cause time to vary)
            six seconds to fold your laundry, one article at a time of course.
